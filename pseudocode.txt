1. Define parameters: 
- scalable grid of squares constructed in JavaScript using DOM methods
- individual grid squares change colour on mouseenter and can later have that colour erased on mouseenter
- buttons allow user to select that colour and to then erase it
- a clear grid button and prompt window allows user to clear grid and reset grid size by number of squares to a maximum 
  of 100 squares within same total grid area size

2. Make a single test square div with id "cell", set #cell CSS rule for dimensions, white colour & grey border.

3. Create a function to change colour of the div "cell" (addEventListener + mouseenter event firing nested function 
changing "cell" color)

4. Repeat to add a few colour options.  

5. Add HTML colour choice button + onclick to fire one of those functions.  

6.  Repeat to add a few colour options. 

7. Create the scalable grid of div "cell" squares to populate a HTML grid container (loop and append to grid container). 

8. Add HTML button to clear screen and send prompt for user to input number of squares. 

9. Test the color change effect and button colour selection effect with the grid, debug.
